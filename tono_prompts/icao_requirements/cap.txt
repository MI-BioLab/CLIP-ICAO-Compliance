The region of the face, from the crown to the base of the chin, and from ear-to-ear, shall be clearly visible.
Special care shall be taken in cases when veils, scarves or head covering cannot be removed for religious reasons to ensure these coverings do not obscure any facial features and do not generate shadow.
Head coverings shall not be accepted except in circumstances specifically approved by the Issuing State of the MRTD.
Such circumstances may be religious, medical or cultural.
If head coverings are allowed, they shall be firm fitting and of a plain uniform colour with no pattern or no visible perforations and the region between hair lines,
both forwards of the ears and chin including cheeks, mouth, eyes, and eyebrows shall be visible without any distortion or shadows.
