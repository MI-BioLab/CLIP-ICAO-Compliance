All images shall have sufficient focus and depth of field to maintain the required level of details.
The camera shall be capable of accurately rendering fine contrasted facial details, such as wrinkles and moles, as small as 1 mm in diameter on the face.
The focus and depth of field of the camera shall be set so that the subjectâ€™s captured image is in focus from nose to ears.
In most cases, a depth of field of 15 cm will be sufficient.
The background behind the subject may be out of focus.
Proper focus and depth-of-field will be assured by either using the camera auto focus function with manual aperture settings or
by pre-focusing the lens at the distance of the subject's eyes and by selecting an appropriate aperture (F-stop) to ensure a depth-of-field of the distance from a subject's nose to ears.
