The background surface behind the subject shall be plain, and shall have no texture containing spots, lines or curves that will be visible in the captured image.
The background shall have a uniform colour.
There may be gradual changes from light to dark luminosity in a single direction, although this may make it more difficult to remove the background during the document production process.
A typical background for the scene is grey with a plain, dull flat surface.
Plain light coloured backgrounds such as light blue or white may be used as long as there is sufficient distinction between the face/hair area and the background.
