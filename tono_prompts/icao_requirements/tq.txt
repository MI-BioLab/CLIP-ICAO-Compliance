The subject should be instructed to look directly at the camera and to keep his or her head erect.
Typically people are able to adopt such a position if instructed.
Care should be taken to maintain the full frontal pose as well as possible.
The shoulders shall be square on to the camera, parallel to the camera imaging plane.
Portrait style photographs where the subject is looking over the shoulder shall not be used.
The pitch of the head shall be less than ± 5° from frontal.
The yaw of the head shall be less than ± 5° from frontal.
The roll of the head shall be less than ± 8°, it is recommended to keep it below ± 5°.
Any stronger pose deviation may have negative impact on facial recognition error rates.
Therefore, effort should be spent to ensure that all angles are as small as possible.
