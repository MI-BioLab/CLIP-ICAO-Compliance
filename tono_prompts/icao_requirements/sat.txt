All images should be captured in colour. Newly designed enrolment should capture colour images only.
The captured portrait shall be a true-colour representation of the holder in a typical colour space such as sRGB as specified in IEC 61966-2.
Other true-colour representations may be used as long as the colour profile is embedded in the image.
Unnaturally coloured lighting, i.e., yellow, red, etc., shall not be used.
The lighting shall produce a face image with naturally looking flesh tones when viewed in typical examination environments.
Colour calibration using an 18% grey background or other method such as white balancing should be applied.
White balance shall be properly set in order to achieve high fidelity skin tones.
