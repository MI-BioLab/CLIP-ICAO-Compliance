Portraits shall have adequate and uniform illumination. Lighting shall be equally distributed on the face, in particular symmetrically, i.e., there is no difference between the brightness of the right and left side of the face.
There shall not be significant direction of the light from the point of view of the camera.
While it is understood that massive shadows on parts of the face will obscure facial details important for identification, having no shadows at all will result in a non-natural appearance.
In such a case, the face will appear flat and without surface features.
Appropriate shadows help distinguish the shape of the nose, eye areas, forehead, cheeks, chin and so on.
Furthermore, lighting and shadows are necessary to show details around the eyes, wrinkles, and scars.
There shall not be extreme dark shadow visible on the face, especially around the nose, in the eye sockets, around the mouth, and between mouth and chin that obscure facial details important for inspection.
The brightness shall be nearly the same on both sides of the face, left and right. All features in the face shall be clearly recognizable, and the volume effect especially around nose and eyes shall render the reality.
