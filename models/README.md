Place in this folder the `phi-4-q4.gguf` model file, which is our model of choice for prompt learning.
You can download it from [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4-gguf/blob/b1e764cfdbdd0a3ed824d6a8424129eb0a2232ff/phi-4-q4.gguf).

We run it on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU, which has 48GB of VRAM.
